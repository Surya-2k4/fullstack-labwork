# Full Stack Framework Lab – 24MCL31 🧑‍💻

This repository provides solutions for the **Full Stack Framework Lab (24MCL31)** designed for **MCA students**. The experiments focus on building full-stack web applications using technologies such as **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, **AngularJS**, along with deployment tools like **Docker** and **VirtualBox**.

## 🧪 List of Experiments

1. **Static Server with Node.js 🌐**  
   Create a simple static server using Node.js to serve HTML and CSS files — no Express.js involved.

2. **Form Handling with Express 📄**  
   Handle form submissions using Express, parse the input, and render the output as JSON using Handlebars.

3. **Student CRUD Application 🧾**  
   Develop a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing student records using Express.js and MongoDB.

4. **AngularJS Counter App 🔢**  
   Build a simple counter application using AngularJS to demonstrate two-way data binding and basic UI logic.

5. **Todo Application using AngularJS ✅**  
   Implement a Todo list where tasks are stored in a JSON file and reloaded dynamically using AngularJS.

6. **User Authentication – Sign-Up/Login 🔐**  
   Create a basic authentication system with sign-up and login functionality using cookies and data persistence in MongoDB or MySQL.

7. **Deploying on a Virtual Machine 💻**  
   Deploy a Node.js application on a virtual machine (e.g., using VirtualBox), and access it via SSH for remote management.

8. **Docker-based Deployment 🐳**  
   Containerize a Node.js application using Docker. Build and run a simple ping server within the container.

9. **MCQ Quiz Application ❓**  
   Develop a dynamic quiz app that fetches multiple-choice questions from the backend, processes responses, and displays the final score.

10. **Blog Website 📚**  
   Create a blog platform with an admin panel for adding/viewing posts, built using Node.js with AngularJS or EJS for rendering.

11. **Voice-Enabled Scientific Calculator 🎤🧮**  
   Design a mobile-view calculator with scientific functions and voice feedback using AngularJS.
